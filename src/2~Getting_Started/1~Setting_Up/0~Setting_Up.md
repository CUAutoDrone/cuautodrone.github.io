# Setting Up a Workspace
The first thing that we want you to do is to set up your computer. You will want a contained space to develop your code, this helps keep your computer organized and clean. Which is otherwise difficult since you will be required to download a lot of 3rd party software, especially for machine learning. Additionally, these environments  come with Python and allow easy use of package managers that allows for easy use of libraries, which we will also be using frequently. We are tailoring  these guides to those using MacOS and Windows, if you are using Linux, you're on your own for this part.

## Your Options
### Anaconda
This is the suggested environment, it is a popular (which means lots of answers to problems) Python distribution that is designed specifically for machine learning. It also comes with a Python package manager preinstalled and natively supports the use of multiple development environments with different package versions. This can be useful because some code has dependencies on older versions of libraries.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
If you are using Windows, you can instead set up WSL. It is essentially a Linux OS that works like a program you can open from the start menu. If you are familiar with virtual machines, it's like that but is more closely integrated with Windows. If you have used WSL before or are familiar with Linux (or want to learn it!), this might be a good option for you. The main drawback is difficulty with drivers required to train computer vision models on the GPU, so if you don't plan on doing that, this is a good option.

# Visual Studio Code
First, download VS Code from [their website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), and follow the installation instructions. When you open VS Code, there will be a navbar with 6 icons on the left side. For now, we only care about 2, **Explorer**, where you can see local files and folders, and **Extensions**, where you can add extra functionality. Go to extensions (you can also use the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X) and search 'Python'. Then, pick the option with the verification checkmark made by Microsoft and click Install. This is an extension that adds some extra features like [autocomplete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_autocomplete-and-intellisense) and [linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting).

Since you'll be spending quite a bit of time using your code editor, it can be worth learning a bit about its many features. Also, learning some helpful shortcuts can drastically speed up how fast you can move around and edit your code.

# Debugging and Testing
Debugging can be one of the more tedious, unfun aspects of coding. Despite this, it is a necessary part of every project. This document will go over a few tricks to get better at debugging and the testing protocols you should adhere to.

## Debugging
- Read things carefully! If theres an error message make sure you read it closely. What line is it on? What is the stack trace? When looking over the code, make sure there aren't stupid mistakes. Is there a typo? Did you forget an import or function parameter? Did you actually call that function?
- Google it. If you find an answer that works, make sure you understand why it works, hopefully you don't have to google the same error twice.
- Check your assumptions. Often a bug will sneak in because something you assumed was true isn't, its worth checking using print statements or VS Code's [debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging). Is that variable what it should be? Does that function work correctly?
- Look at documentation. If your using a library make sure your doing it correctly! Sometimes the parameters are unintuitive or poorly explained. First, try to find the official documentation as its almost guaranteed to have correct information. Here are the websites for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html), [PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [OpenCV2](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html), and the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). But, if the official documentation sucks, look somewhere else. Finding examples (even if they're poorly explained) can often be helpful. Both [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=shm) tend to have pretty good explanations for Python.
- Ask a friend! Often just explaining the problem can [help you find the solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) but even if it doesn't, having a fresh pair of eyes on the problem usually helps.

### VS Code Debugger
VS Code offers some helpful debugging tools that allow you to pause code execution and check the values of variables and

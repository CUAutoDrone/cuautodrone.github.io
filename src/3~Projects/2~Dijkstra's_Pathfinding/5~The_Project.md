# What am I even doing again?

Now that you have a solid understanding of all of the terms you are likely to encounter while understanding Dijkstra's, it's time to actually start the project. This is a very open ended challenge, we want you to research Dijkstra's using whatever resources you'd like and implement it on a grid. 

You need to have a way to create a grid with obstacles and then a way to call the pathfinding algorithm which will return a path. The method of representation for inputs and outputs is up to you, but you need to make sure they are properly documented so that someone else could use your code easily. 

Additionally, we would like you to create a visualization tool so that we can check that your algorithms are working correctly. This can work however you'd like but needs to show obstacles and the path so that the correctness of the implementation can be verified. It is recommend that as soon as you decide on a data format, you create this tool, this will make it much easier to debug as you can see what the algorithm is outputting in an easily understood format. 

Finally, don't be afraid to iterate on the implementation, if you get far into the process and realize that a choice you made earlier waws a bad one, it's ok to backtrack and fix it. Also, remember to check the debugging and code quality sections or reach out for help if you need it. Good luck!

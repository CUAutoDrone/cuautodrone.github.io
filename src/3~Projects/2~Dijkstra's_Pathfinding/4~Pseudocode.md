# Pseudocode
Psudocode is a way of communicating the high level workings of an algorithm that ignores the implementation and just describes the general logic. There is no one standard way to write psudocode, but a few you will often see. Generally, when researching an algorithm, psudocode is a great place to start because it gives you a broad idea of how the algorithm works without worrying about the implementation details or optimizations. While psudocode is ideally easy to read, it often relies on some specialized notation.

```{algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Example}
\begin{algorithmic}
\WHILE{$G \neq \emptyset$}
\COMMENT{This is a while loop thats continues as long as $G$ is not empty$\newline\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\emptyset$ is the emptyset, which really just means that it's empty}
\STATE{$x \gets x + 1$}
\COMMENT{This is an assignment, read ``$x$ gets $x + 1$"}
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

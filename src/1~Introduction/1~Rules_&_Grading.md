# Rules and Grading

Members who take CUAD will receive a grade at the end of the semester, since they are taking it for credit.

If you are a freshman, you will enroll in an introductory Project Team Course, ENGRG 1400, led by the College of Engineering for 1 credit. This class is S/U and has a series of assignments that you must complete by the end of the semester.

If you are an upperclassman or in your second semester with CUAD, you can enroll in ENGRG 3400 for up to 3 credits. These credits will be graded.

The grading guidelines for CUAD are included below for clarity.  These are just to ensure that you are putting in an appropriate amount of commitment towards CUAD, and making a genuine effort to learn and be involved with the team!

Keep in mind, the amount of credits you are taking CUAD for will impact how many hours you are expected to commit! (3 hours per credit, per week)

## Attendance Policy

### Meetings
- At every Gbody and subteam meeting attendance will be taken. Over the course of the semester you are allowed 4 free absences, this is to account for things like a busy week, getting the flu etc. if possible you should let your lead know when you are using one of these absences but it is not necessary. If you have a prelim the same day as a meeting, that counts as an excused absence and won't count against you. Finally, for emergencies please reach out to your lead with the situation

### Exceptions
- Members are excused from late notifications in case of emergences or other extenuating circumstances
- In the case of such circumstances, members should reach out to leads in order to come up with a plan for how to make up the missed meetings.

### Further Points

- Please note that attendance and grading policies are subject to change.
- Don't stress too much about grading! As long as you make a very good effort to participate and contribute, you should be fine!
- Please don't be afraid of reaching out to leads if you have special circumstances or need accommodations -- we are here to support you and help in any way we can.  We are students as well, and understand that things may come up.

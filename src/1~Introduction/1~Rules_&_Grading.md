# Rules and Grading

Members who take CUAD will receive a grade at the end of the semester, since they are taking it for credit.

If you are a freshman, you will enroll in an introductory Project Team Course, ENGRG 1400, led by the College of Engineering for 1 credit. This class is S/U and has a series of assignments that you must complete by the end of the semester.

If you are an upperclassman or in your second semester with CUAD, you can enroll in ENGRG 3400 for up to 2 credits. These credits will be graded.

The grading guidelines for CUAD are included below for clarity.  These are just to ensure that you are putting in an appropriate amount of commitment towards CUAD, and making a genuine effort to learn and be involved with the team!

Keep in mind, the amount of credits you are taking CUAD for will impact how many hours you are expected to commit! (3 hours per credit, per week)
